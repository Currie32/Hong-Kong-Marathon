# Hong-Kong-Marathon
An short exploratory analysis of the 2016 Hong Kong Marathon. 

The data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/melvincheung/hong-kong-marathon-2016

I suggest looking at the HTML file if you only want to see my final report, but if you would like to see my code as well, view the Rmd file.
